<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>The Hyper-V provider is used just like any other provider. Please
read the general <a href="../providers/basic_usage.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/basic_usage.html">basic usage</a> page for
providers.</p>

<p>The value to use for the <code>--provider</code> flag is <code>hyperv</code>.</p>

<p>Hyper-V also requires that you execute Vagrant with administrative
privileges. Creating and managing virtual machines with Hyper-V requires
admin rights. Vagrant will show you an error if it doesn&#39;t have the proper
permissions.</p>
