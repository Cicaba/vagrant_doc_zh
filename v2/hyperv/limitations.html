<h1>Limitations</h1>

<p>The Hyper-V provider works in almost every way like the VirtualBox
or VMware provider would, but has some limitations that are inherent to
Hyper-V itself.</p>

<h2>Limited Networking</h2>

<p>Vagrant doesn&#39;t yet know how to create and configure new networks for
Hyper-V. When launching a machine with Hyper-V, Vagrant will prompt you
asking what virtual switch you want to connect the virtual machine to.</p>

<p>A result of this is that networking configurations in the Vagrantfile
are completely ignored with Hyper-V. Vagrant can&#39;t enforce a static IP
or automatically configure a NAT.</p>

<p>However, the IP address of the machine will be reported as part of
the <code>vagrant up</code>, and you can use that IP address as if it were
a host only network.</p>

<h2>Packaging</h2>

<p>Vagrant doesn&#39;t implement the <code>vagrant package</code> command for Hyper-V
yet, though this should be fairly straightforward to add in a Vagrant
release in the near future.</p>
