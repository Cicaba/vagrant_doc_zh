<h1>Basic Provider Usage</h1>

<h2>Boxes</h2>

<p>Boxes are all provider-specific. A box for VirtualBox is incompatible with
the VMware Fusion provider, or any other provider. A box must be installed
for each provider, and can share the same name as other boxes as long
as the providers differ. So you can have both a VirtualBox and VMware Fusion
&quot;precise64&quot; box.</p>

<p>Installing boxes hasn&#39;t changed at all:</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant box add \
  precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
</code></pre>

<p>Vagrant now automatically detects what provider a box is for. This is
visible when listing boxes. Vagrant puts the provider in parentheses next
to the name, as can be seen below.</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant box list
precise64 (virtualbox)
precise64 (vmware_fusion)
</code></pre>

<h2>Vagrant Up</h2>

<p>Once a provider is installed, you can use it by calling <code>vagrant up</code>
with the <code>--provider</code> flag. This will force Vagrant to use that specific
provider. No other configuration is necessary!</p>

<p>In normal day-to-day usage, the <code>--provider</code> flag isn&#39;t necessary
since Vagrant can usually pick the right provider for you. More details
on how it does this is below.</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant up --provider=vmware_fusion
</code></pre>

<p>If you specified a <code>--provider</code> flag, you only need to do this for the
<code>up</code> command. Once a machine is up and running, Vagrant is able to
see what provider is backing a running machine, so commands such as
<code>destroy</code>, <code>suspend</code>, etc. do not need to be told what provider to use.</p>

    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>
        Vagrant currently restricts you to bringing up one provider per machine.
        If you have a multi-machine environment, you can bring up one machine
        backed by VirtualBox and another backed by VMware Fusion, for example, but you
        can't back the <em>same machine</em> with both VirtualBox and
        VMware Fusion.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a limitation that will be removed in a future version of
        Vagrant.
    </p>

<h2>Default Provider</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, you typically don&#39;t need to specify <code>--provider</code>
<em>ever</em>. Vagrant is smart enough about being able to detect the provider
you want for a given environment.</p>

<p>Vagrant attempts to find the default provider in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <code>--provider</code> flag on a <code>vagrant up</code> is chosen above all else, if
 it is present.</p></li>
<li><p>If the <code>VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER</code> environmental variable is set,
 it takes next priority and will be the provider chosen.</p></li>
<li><p>Vagrant will go through all of the <code>config.vm.provider</code> calls in the
 Vagrantfile and try each in order. It will choose the first provider
 that is usable. For example, if you configure Hyper-V, it will never
 be chosen on Mac this way. It must be both configured and usable.</p></li>
<li><p>Vagrant will go through all installed provider plugins (including the
 ones that come with Vagrant), and find the first plugin that reports
 it is usable. There is a priority system here: systems that are known
 better have a higher priority than systems that are worse. For example,
 if you have the VMware provider installed, it will always take priority
 over VirtualBox.</p></li>
<li><p>If Vagrant still hasn&#39;t found any usable providers, it will error.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Using this method, there are very few cases that Vagrant doesn&#39;t find the
correct provider for you. This also allows each
<a href="../vagrantfile/index.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/">Vagrantfile</a> to define what providers
the development environment is made for by ordering provider configurations.</p>

<p>A trick is to use <code>config.vm.provider</code> with no configuration at the top of
your Vagrantfile to define the order of providers you prefer to support:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  # ... other config up here

  # Prefer VMware Fusion before VirtualBox
  config.vm.provider &quot;vmware_fusion&quot;
  config.vm.provider &quot;virtualbox&quot;
end
</code></pre>
