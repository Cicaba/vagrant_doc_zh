<h1>Configuration</h1>

<p>While well-behaved providers should work with any Vagrantfile with sane
defaults, providers generally expose unique configuration
options so that you can get the most out of each provider.</p>

<p>This provider-specific configuration is done within the Vagrantfile
in a way that is portable, easy to use, and easy to understand.</p>

<h2>Portability</h2>

<p>An important fact is that even if you configure other providers within
a Vagrantfile, the Vagrantfile remains portable even to individuals who
don&#39;t necessarily have that provider installed.</p>

<p>For example, if you configure VMware Fusion and send it to an individual
who doesn&#39;t have the VMware Fusion provider, Vagrant will silently ignore
that part of the configuration.</p>

<h2>Provider Configuration</h2>

<p>Configuring a specific provider looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  # ... (other config)

  config.vm.provider &quot;virtualbox&quot; do |vb|
    vb.customize [&quot;modifyvm&quot;, :id, &quot;--cpuexecutioncap&quot;, &quot;50&quot;]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Multiple <code>config.vm.provider</code> blocks can exist to configure multiple
providers.</p>

<p>The configuration format should look very similar to how provisioners
are configured. The <code>config.vm.provider</code> takes a single parameter: the
name of the provider being configured. Then, an inner block with custom
configuration options is exposed that can be used to configure that
provider.</p>

<p>This inner configuration differs among providers, so please read the
documentation for your provider of choice to see available configuration
options.</p>

<p>Remember, some providers don&#39;t require any provider-specific configuration
and work directly out of the box. Provider-specific configuration is meant
as a way to expose more options to get the most of the provider of your
choice. It is not meant as a roadblock to running against a specific provider.</p>

<h2>Overriding Configuration</h2>

<p>Providers can also override non-provider specific configuration, such
as <code>config.vm.box</code> and any other Vagrant configuration. This is done by
specifying a second argument to <code>config.vm.provider</code>. This argument is
just like the normal <code>config</code>, so set any settings you want, and they will
be overridden only for that provider.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.box = &quot;precise64&quot;

  config.vm.provider &quot;vmware_fusion&quot; do |v, override|
    override.vm.box = &quot;precise64_fusion&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In the above case, Vagrant will use the &quot;precise64&quot; box by default, but
will use &quot;precise64_fusion&quot; if the VMware Fusion provider is used.</p>

        <strong>The Vagrant Way:</strong> The proper "Vagrant way" is to
        avoid any provider-specific overrides if possible by making boxes
        for multiple providers that are as identical as possible, since box
        names can map to multiple providers. However, this isn't always possible,
        and in those cases, overrides are available.
