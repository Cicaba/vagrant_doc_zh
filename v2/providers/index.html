<h1>Providers</h1>

<p>While Vagrant ships out of the box with support for <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.virtualbox.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.virtualbox.org/%27" tppabs="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>,
Vagrant has the ability to manage other types of machines as well. This is done
by using other <em>providers</em> with Vagrant.</p>

<p>Alternate providers can offer different features that make more sense in your use case.
For example, if you&#39;re using Vagrant for any real work, <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.vmware.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.vmware.com/%27" tppabs="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>
providers are recommended since they&#39;re well supported and generally more
stable and performant than VirtualBox.</p>

<p>Before you can use another provider, you must install it. Vagrant only ships
with VirtualBox support. Installation of other providers is done via the
Vagrant plugin system.</p>

<p>Once the provider is installed, usage is straightforward and simple, as
you would expect with Vagrant. Read into the relevant subsections found in
the navigation to the left for more information.</p>
