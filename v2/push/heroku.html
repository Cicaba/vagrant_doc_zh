application. The Vagrant Push Heroku strategy pushes your application&#39;s code to
Heroku.</p>

    <strong>Warning:</strong> The Vagrant Push Heroku strategy requires you
    have configured your Heroku credentials and created the Heroku application.
    This documentation will not cover these prerequisites, but you can read more
    about them in the <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://devcenter.heroku.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://devcenter.heroku.com/%27" tppabs="https://devcenter.heroku.com/">Heroku documentation</a>.

<p>Only files which are committed to the Git repository will be pushed to Heroku.
Additionally, the current working branch is always pushed to the Heroku, even if
it is not the &quot;master&quot; branch.</p>

<p>The Vagrant Push Heroku strategy supports the following configuration options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>app</code> - The name of the Heroku application. If the Heroku application does not
exist, an exception will be raised. If this value is not specified, the
basename of the directory containing the <code>Vagrantfile</code> is assumed to be the
name of the Heroku application. Since this value can change between users, it
is highly recommended that you add the <code>app</code> setting to your <code>Vagrantfile</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dir</code> - The base directory containing the Git repository to upload to Heroku.
By default this is the same directory as the Vagrantfile, but you can specify
this if you have a nested Git directory.</p></li>
<li><p><code>remote</code> - The name of the Git remote where Heroku is configured. The default
value is &quot;heroku&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>The Vagrant Push Heroku strategy is defined in the <code>Vagrantfile</code> using the
<code>heroku</code> key:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">config.push.define &quot;heroku&quot; do |push|
  push.app = &quot;my_application&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then push the application to Heroku:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">$ vagrant push
</code></pre>
