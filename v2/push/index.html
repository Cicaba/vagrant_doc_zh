<h1>Vagrant Push</h1>

<p>As of version 1.7, Vagrant is capable of deploying or &quot;pushing&quot; application code
in the same directory as your Vagrantfile to a remote such as an FTP server or
<a title="HashiCorp's Atlas Service" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://atlas.hashicorp.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://atlas.hashicorp.com/%27" tppabs="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/">HashiCorp&#39;s Atlas</a>.</p>

<p>Pushes are defined in an application&#39;s <code>Vagrantfile</code> and are invoked using the
<code>vagrant push</code> subcommand. Much like other components of Vagrant, each Vagrant
Push plugin has its own configuration options. Please consult the documentation
for your Vagrant Push plugin for more information. Here is an example Vagrant
Push configuration section in a <code>Vagrantfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">config.push.define &quot;ftp&quot; do |push|
  push.host = &quot;ftp.company.com&quot;
  push.username = &quot;...&quot;
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>When the application is ready to be deployed to the FTP server, just run a
single command:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">$ vagrant push
</code></pre>

<p>Much like <a title="Vagrant Providers" href="../providers/index.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/">Vagrant Providers</a>, Vagrant Push also supports multiple backend
declarations. Consider the common scenario of a staging and QA environment:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">config.push.define &quot;staging&quot;, strategy: &quot;ftp&quot; do |push|
  # ...
end

config.push.define &quot;qa&quot;, strategy: &quot;ftp&quot; do |push|
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>In this scenario, the user must pass the name of the Vagrant Push to the
subcommand:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">$ vagrant push staging
</code></pre>

<p>Vagrant Push is the easiest way to deploy your application. You can read more
in the documentation links on the sidebar.</p>
