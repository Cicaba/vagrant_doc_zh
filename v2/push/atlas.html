the <code>dir</code>. This value may be specified multiple times and is additive.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dir</code> - The base directory containing the files to upload. By default this is
the same directory as the Vagrantfile, but you can specify this if you have
a <code>src</code> folder or <code>bin</code> folder or some other folder you want to upload.</p></li>
<li><p><code>vcs</code> - If set to true, Vagrant will automatically use VCS data to determine
the files to upload. Uncommitted changes will not be deployed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the following options are exposed for power users of the Vagrant
Atlas push strategy. Most users will not require these options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>address</code> - The address of the Atlas server to upload to. By default this will
be the public Atlas server.</p></li>
<li><p><code>token</code> - The Atlas token to use. If the user has run <code>vagrant login</code>, this
will the token generated by that command. If the environment variable
<code>ATLAS_TOKEN</code> is set, the uploader will use this value. By default, this is
nil.</p></li>
</ul>
