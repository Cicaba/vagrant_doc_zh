<h1>RDP</h1>

<p><strong>Command: <code>vagrant rdp</code></strong></p>

<p>This will start an RDP client for a remote desktop session with the
guest. This only works for Vagrant environments that support remote
desktop, which is typically only Windows.</p>

<h2>Raw Arguments</h2>

<p>You can pass raw arguments through to your RDP client on the
command-line by appending it after a <code>--</code>. Vagrant just passes
these through. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant rdp -- /span
...
</code></pre>

<p>The above command on Windows will execute <code>mstsc.exe /span config.rdp</code>,
allowing your RDP to span multiple desktops.</p>
