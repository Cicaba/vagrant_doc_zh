<h1>More Commands</h1>

<p>In addition to the commands listed in the sidebar and shown in <code>vagrant -h</code>,
Vagrant comes with some more commands that are hidden from basic help output.
These commands are hidden because they&#39;re not useful to beginners or they&#39;re
not commonly used. We call these commands &quot;non-primary subcommands&quot;.</p>

<p>You can view all subcommands, including the non-primary subcommands,
by running <code>vagrant list-commands</code>, which itself is a non-primary subcommand!</p>

<p>Note that while you have to run a special command to list the non-primary
subcommands, you don&#39;t have to do anything special to actually <em>run</em> the
non-primary subcommands. They&#39;re executed just like any other subcommand:
<code>vagrant COMMAND</code>.</p>

<p>The list of non-primary commands is below. Click on any command to learn
more about it.</p>
