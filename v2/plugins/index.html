<p>Vagrant comes with many great features out of the box to get your environments up
and running. Sometimes, however, you want to change the way Vagrant does something
or add additional functionality to Vagrant. This can be done via Vagrant
<em>plugins</em>.</p>

<p>Plugins are powerful, first-class citizens that extend Vagrant using a
well-documented, stable API that can withstand major version upgrades.</p>

plugin API, you can be confident that the interface is stable and well supported.</p>
