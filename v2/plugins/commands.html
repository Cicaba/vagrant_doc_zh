<h1>Plugin Development: Commands</h1>

<p>This page documents how to add new commands to Vagrant, invokable
via <code>vagrant YOUR-COMMAND</code>. Prior to reading this, you should be familiar
with the <a href="development-basics.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/development-basics.html">plugin development basics</a>.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warn">
    <p>
        <strong>Warning: Advanced Topic!</strong> Developing plugins is an
        advanced topic that only experienced Vagrant users who are reasonably
        comfortable with Ruby should approach.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>Definition Component</h2>

<p>Within the context of a plugin definition, new commands can be defined
like so:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">command &quot;foo&quot; do
  require_relative &quot;command&quot;
  Command
end
</code></pre>

<p>Commands are defined with the <code>command</code> method, which takes as an argument
the name of the command, in this case &quot;foo.&quot; This means the command will be
invokable via <code>vagrant foo</code>. Then the block argument returns a class that
implements the <code>Vagrant.plugin(2, &quot;command&quot;)</code> interface.</p>

<p>You can also define <em>non-primary commands</em>. These commands do not show
up in the <code>vagrant -h</code> output. They only show up if the user explicitly
does a <code>vagrant list-commands</code> which shows the full listing of available
commands. This is useful for highly specific commands or plugins that a
beginner to Vagrant would not be using anyways. Vagrant itself uses non-primary
commands to expose some internal functions, as well.</p>

<p>To define a non-primary command:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">command(&quot;foo&quot;, primary: false) do
  require_relative &quot;command&quot;
  Command
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Implementations of commands should subclass <code>Vagrant.plugin(2, :command)</code>,
which is a Vagrant method that will return the proper superclass for
a version 2 command. The implementation itself is quite simple, since the
class needs to only implement a single method: <code>execute</code>. Example:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Command &lt; Vagrant.plugin(2, :command)
  def execute
    puts &quot;Hello!&quot;
    0
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>execute</code> method is called when the command is invoked, and it should
return the exit status (0 for success, anything else for error).</p>

<p>This is a command at its simplest form. Of course, the command superclass
gives you access to the Vagrant environment and provides some helpers to
do common tasks such as command line parsing.</p>

<h2>Parsing Command-Line Options</h2>

<p>The <code>parse_options</code> method is available which will parse the command line
for you. It takes an <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html%27" tppabs="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html">OptionParser</a>
as an argument, and adds some common elements to it such as the <code>--help</code> flag,
automatically showing help if requested. View the API docs directly for more
information.</p>

<p>This is recommended over raw parsing/manipulation of command line flags.
The following is an example of parsing command line flags pulled directly
from the built-in Vagrant <code>destroy</code> command:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">options = {}
options[:force] = false

opts = OptionParser.new do |o|
  o.banner = &quot;Usage: vagrant destroy [vm-name]&quot;
  o.separator &quot;&quot;

  o.on(&quot;-f&quot;, &quot;--force&quot;, &quot;Destroy without confirmation.&quot;) do |f|
    options[:force] = f
  end
end

# Parse the options
argv = parse_options(opts)
</code></pre>

<h2>Using Vagrant Machines</h2>

<p>The <code>with_target_vms</code> method is a helper that helps you interact with
the machines that Vagrant manages in a standard Vagrant way. This method
automatically does the right thing in the case of multi-machine environments,
handling target machines on the command line (<code>vagrant foo my-vm</code>), etc.
If you need to do any manipulation of a Vagrant machine, including SSH
access, this helper should be used.</p>

<p>An example of using the helper, again pulled directly from the built-in
<code>destroy</code> command:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">with_target_vms(argv, reverse: true) do |machine|
  machine.action(:destroy)
end
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, it asks for the machines in reverse order and calls the
destroy action on each of them. If a user says <code>vagrant destroy foo</code>, then
the helper automatically only yields the <code>foo</code> machine. If no parameter
is given and it is a multi-machine environment, every machine in the environment
is yielded, and so on. It just does the right thing.</p>

<h2>Using the Raw Vagrant Environment</h2>

<p>The raw loaded <code>Vagrant::Environment</code> object is available with the
&#39;@env&#39; instance variable.</p>
