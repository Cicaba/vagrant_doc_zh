<h1>Networking</h1>

<p>In order to access the Vagrant environment created, Vagrant exposes
some high-level networking options for things such as forwarded ports,
connecting to a public network, or creating a private network.</p>

<p>The high-level networking options are meant to define an abstraction that
works across multiple <a href="../providers/index.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/">providers</a>. This means that
you can take your Vagrantfile you used to spin up a VirtualBox machine and
you can reasonably expect that Vagrantfile to behave the same with something
like VMware.</p>

<p>You should first read the <a href="basic_usage.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/basic_usage.html">basic usage</a> page
and then continue by reading the documentation for a specific networking
primitive by following the navigation to the left.</p>

<h2>Advanced Configuration</h2>

<p>In some cases,
these options are <em>too</em> high-level, and you may want to more finely tune
and configure the network interfaces of the underlying machine. Most
providers expose <a href="../providers/configuration.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/configuration.html">provider-specific configuration</a>
to do this, so please read the documentation for your specific provider
to see what options are available.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>For beginners:</strong> It is strongly recommended you use
        only the high-level networking options until you are comfortable
        with the Vagrant workflow and have things working at a basic level.
        Provider-specific network configuration can very quickly lock you out
        of your guest machine if improperly done.
