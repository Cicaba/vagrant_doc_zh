<h1>Public Networks</h1>

<p><strong>Network identifier: <code>public_network</code></strong></p>

<p>Public networks are less private than private networks, and the exact
meaning actually varies from <a href="../providers/index.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/">provider to provider</a>,
hence the ambiguous definition. The idea is that while
<a href="private_network.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/private_network.html">private networks</a> should never allow the
general public access to your machine, public networks can.</p>

        <strong>Confused?</strong> We kind of are, too. It is likely that
        public networks will be replaced by <code>:bridged</code> in a
        future release, since that is in general what should be done with
        public networks, and providers that don't support bridging generally
        don't have any other features that map to public networks either.

        <strong>Warning!</strong> Vagrant boxes are insecure by default 
        and by design, featuring public passwords, insecure keypairs 
        for SSH access, and potentially allow root access over SSH.  With
        these known credentials, your box is easily accessible by anyone on
        your network.  Before configuring Vagrant to use a public network,
        consider <em>all</em> potential security implications
        and review the <a href="../boxes/base.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes/base.html">default box
        configuration</a> to identify potential security risks.

<h2>DHCP</h2>

<p>The easiest way to use a public network is to allow the IP to be assigned
via DHCP. In this case, defining a public network is trivially easy:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.network &quot;public_network&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>When DHCP is used, the IP can be determined by using <code>vagrant ssh</code> to
SSH into the machine and using the appropriate command line tool to find
the IP, such as <code>ifconfig</code>.</p>

<h2>Static IP</h2>

<p>Depending on your setup, you may wish to manually set the IP of your
bridged interface. To do so, add a <code>:ip</code> clause to the network definition.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">config.vm.network &quot;public_network&quot;, ip: &quot;192.168.0.17&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2>Default Network Interface</h2>

<p>If more than one network interface is available on the host machine, Vagrant will
ask you to choose which interface the virtual machine should bridge to. A default
interface can be specified by adding a <code>:bridge</code> clause to the network definition.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">config.vm.network &quot;public_network&quot;, bridge: &#39;en1: Wi-Fi (AirPort)&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>The string identifying the desired interface must exactly match the name of an
available interface. If it can&#39;t be found, Vagrant will ask you to pick
from a list of available network interfaces.</p>
