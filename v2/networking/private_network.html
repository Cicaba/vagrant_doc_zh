<h1>Private Networks</h1>

<p><strong>Network identifier: <code>private_network</code></strong></p>

<p>Private networks allow you to access your guest machine by some address
that is not publicly accessible from the global internet. In general, this
means your machine gets an address in the <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_address_spaces%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_address_spaces">private address space</a>.</p>

<p>Multiple machines within the same private network (also usually with the
restriction that they&#39;re backed by the same <a href="../providers/index.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/">provider</a>)
can communicate with each other on private networks.</p>

        <strong>Guest operating system support.</strong> Private networks
        generally require configuring the network adapters on the guest
        machine. This process varies from OS to OS. Vagrant ships with
        knowledge of how to configure networks on a variety of guest
        operating systems, but it is possible if you're using a particularly
        old or new operating system that private networks won't properly
        configure.

<h2>DHCP</h2>

<p>The easiest way to use a private network is to allow the IP to be assigned
via DHCP.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.network &quot;private_network&quot;, type: &quot;dhcp&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>This will automatically assign an IP address from the reserved address space.
The IP address can be determined by using <code>vagrant ssh</code> to SSH into the
machine and using the appropriate command line tool to find the IP,
such as <code>ifconfig</code>.</p>

<h2>Static IP</h2>

<p>You can also specify a static IP address for the machine. This lets you
access the Vagrant managed machine using a static, known IP. The
Vagrantfile for a static IP looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.network &quot;private_network&quot;, ip: &quot;192.168.50.4&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>It is up to the users to make sure that the static IP doesn&#39;t collide
with any other machines on the same network.</p>

<p>While you can choose any IP you&#39;d like, you <em>should</em> use an IP from
the <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_address_spaces%27" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_address_spaces">reserved private address space</a>. These IPs are guaranteed to never be publicly routable,
and most routers actually block traffic from going to them from the
outside world.</p>

<h2>Disable Auto-Configuration</h2>

<p>If you want to manually configure the network interface yourself, you
can disable Vagrant&#39;s auto-configure feature by specifying <code>auto_config</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.network &quot;private_network&quot;, ip: &quot;192.168.50.4&quot;,
    auto_config: false
end
</code></pre>
