<h1>Basic Usage</h1>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Synced folders are configured within your Vagrantfile using the
<code>config.vm.synced_folder</code> method. Usage of the configuration directive
is very simple:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  # other config here

  config.vm.synced_folder &quot;src/&quot;, &quot;/srv/website&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>The first parameter is a path to a directory on the host machine. If
the path is relative, it is relative to the project root. The second
parameter must be an absolute path of where to share the folder within
the guest machine. This folder will be created (recursively, if it must)
if it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>You may also specify additional optional parameters when configuring 
synced folders. These options are listed below. More detailed examples of using
some of these options are shown below this section, note the owner/group example
supplies two additional options separated by commas.</p>

<p>In addition to these options, the specific synced folder type might
allow more options. See the documentation for your specific synced folder
type for more details. The built-in synced folder types are documented
in other pages available in the navigation for these docs.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>create</code> (boolean) - If true, the host path will be created if it
does not exist. Defaults to false.</p></li>
<li><p><code>disabled</code> (boolean) - If true, this synced folder will be disabled and
won&#39;t be setup. This can be used to disable a previously defined synced
folder or to conditionally disable a definition based on some external
factor.</p></li>
<li><p><code>group</code> (string) - The group that will own the synced folder. By default
this will be the SSH user. Some synced folder types don&#39;t support
modifying the group.</p></li>
<li><p><code>mount_options</code> (array) - A list of additional mount options to pass
to the <code>mount</code> command.</p></li>
<li><p><code>owner</code> (string) - The user who should be the owner of this synced folder.
By default this will be the SSH user. Some synced folder types don&#39;t
support modifying the owner.</p></li>
<li><p><code>type</code> (string) - The type of synced folder. If this is not specified,
Vagrant will automatically choose the best synced folder option for your
environment. Otherwise, you can specify a specific type such as &quot;nfs&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Enabling</h2>

<p>Synced folders are automatically setup during <code>vagrant up</code> and
<code>vagrant reload</code>.</p>

<h2>Disabling</h2>

<p>Synced folders can be disabled by adding the <code>disabled</code> option to
any definition:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.synced_folder &quot;src/&quot;, &quot;/srv/website&quot;, disabled: true
end
</code></pre>

<p>Disabling the default <code>/vagrant</code> share can be done as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">config.vm.synced_folder &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/vagrant&quot;, disabled: true
</code></pre>

<h2>Modifying the Owner/Group</h2>

<p>By default, Vagrant mounts the synced folders with the owner/group set
to the SSH user. Sometimes it is preferable to mount folders with a different
owner and group. It is possible to set these options:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">config.vm.synced_folder &quot;src/&quot;, &quot;/srv/website&quot;,
  owner: &quot;root&quot;, group: &quot;root&quot;
</code></pre>
