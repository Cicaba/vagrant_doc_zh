<h1>Synced Folders</h1>

<p>Synced folders enable Vagrant to sync a folder on the host machine to the
guest machine, allowing you to continue working on your project&#39;s files
on your host machine, but use the resources in the guest machine to
compile or run your project.</p>

<p>By default, Vagrant will share your project directory (the directory
with the <a href="../vagrantfile/index.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/">Vagrantfile</a>) to <code>/vagrant</code>.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="basic_usage.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/basic_usage.html">basic usage</a> page to get started
with synced folders.</p>
