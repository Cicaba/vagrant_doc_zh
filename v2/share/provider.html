        <strong>Warning: Advanced Topic!</strong> This topic is related to
        developing Vagrant plugins. If you're not interested in this or
        you're just starting with Vagrant, it is safe to skip this page.

<p>If you&#39;re developing a <a href="../plugins/providers.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/providers.html">custom provider</a>, you&#39;ll
need to do a tiny bit more work in order for it to work well with Vagrant
Share.</p>

<p>For now, this is only one step:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>public_address</code> provider capability - You must implement this capability
to return a string that is an address that can be used to access the
guest from Vagrant. This does not need to be a globally routable address,
it only needs to be accessible from the machine running Vagrant. If you
can&#39;t detect an address, return <code>nil</code>.</li>
</ul>
