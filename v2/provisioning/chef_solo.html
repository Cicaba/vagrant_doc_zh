<h1>Chef Solo Provisioner</h1>

<p><strong>Provisioner name: <code>chef_solo</code></strong></p>

<p>The Chef Solo provisioner allows you to provision the guest using

<p>Chef Solo is ideal for people who are already experienced with Chef,
already have Chef cookbooks, or are looking to learn Chef. Specifically,
this documentation page will not go into how to use Chef or how to write
Chef cookbooks, since Chef is a complete system that is beyond the scope
of a single page of documentation.</p>

        <strong>Warning:</strong> If you're not familiar with Chef and Vagrant already,
        I recommend starting with the <a href="shell.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/shell.html">shell
        provisioner</a>. However, if you're comfortable with Vagrant already, Vagrant
        is the best way to learn Chef.

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>This section lists the complete set of available options for the Chef Solo
provisioner. More detailed examples of how to use the provisioner are
available below this section.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>cookbooks_path</code> (string or array) - A list of paths to where cookbooks
are stored. By default this is &quot;cookbooks&quot;, expecting a cookbooks folder
relative to the Vagrantfile location.</p></li>
<li><p><code>data_bags_path</code> (string) - A path where data bags are stored. By default, no
data bag path is set.</p></li>
<li><p><code>environments_path</code> (string) - A path where environment definitions are
located. By default, no environments folder is set.</p></li>
<li><p><code>environment</code> (string) - The environment you want the Chef run to be
a part of. This requires Chef 11.6.0 or later, and that <code>environments_path</code>
is set.</p></li>
<li><p><code>recipe_url</code> (string) - URL to an archive of cookbooks that Chef will download
and use.</p></li>
<li><p><code>roles_path</code> (string or array) - A list of paths where roles are defined.
By default this is empty. Multiple role directories are only supported by
Chef 11.8.0 and later.</p></li>
<li><p><code>synced_folder_type</code> (string) - The type of synced folders to use when
sharing the data required for the provisioner to work properly. By default
this will use the default synced folder type. For example, you can set this
to &quot;nfs&quot; to use NFS synced folders.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to all the options listed above, the Chef Solo provisioner supports
the <a href="chef_common.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/chef_common.html">common options for all Chef provisioners</a>.</p>

<h2>Specifying a Run List</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get started with the Chef Solo provisioner is to just
specify a <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_node_object_run_lists.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_node_object_run_lists.html%27" tppabs="http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_node_object_run_lists.html">run list</a>. This looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;chef_solo&quot; do |chef|
    chef.add_recipe &quot;apache&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This causes Vagrant to run Chef Solo with the &quot;apache&quot; cookbook. The cookbooks
by default are looked for in the &quot;cookbooks&quot; directory relative to your
project root. The directory structure ends up looking like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ tree
.
|-- Vagrantfile
|-- cookbooks
|   |-- apache
|       |-- recipes
|           |-- default.rb
</code></pre>

<p>The order of the calls to <code>add_recipe</code> will specify the order of the run list.
Earlier recipes added with <code>add_recipe</code> are run before later recipes added.</p>

<h2>Custom Cookbooks Path</h2>

<p>Instead of using the default &quot;cookbooks&quot; directory, a custom cookbooks
path can also be set via the <code>cookbooks_path</code> configuration directive:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;chef_solo&quot; do |chef|
    chef.cookbooks_path = &quot;my_cookbooks&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The path can be relative or absolute. If it is relative, it is relative
to the project root.</p>

<p>The configuration value can also be an array of paths:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;chef_solo&quot; do |chef|
    chef.cookbooks_path = [&quot;cookbooks&quot;, &quot;my_cookbooks&quot;]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Roles</h2>

<p>Vagrant also supports provisioning with <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_roles.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_roles.html%27" tppabs="http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_roles.html">Chef roles</a>.
This is done by specifying a path to a roles folder where roles are defined
and by adding roles to your run list:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;chef_solo&quot; do |chef|
    chef.roles_path = &quot;roles&quot;
    chef.add_role(&quot;web&quot;)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Just like the cookbooks path, the roles path is relative to the project
root if a relative path is given.</p>

<p>The configuration value can also be an array of paths on Chef 11.8.0 and newer.
On older Chef versions only the first path is used.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The name of the role file must be the same as the role name.
For example the <code>web</code> role must be in the <code>roles_path</code> as web.json or web.rb.
This is required by Chef itself, and isn&#39;t a limitation imposed by
Vagrant.</p>

<h2>Data Bags</h2>

<p><a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html%27" tppabs="http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html">Data bags</a> are also
supported by the Chef Solo provisioner. This is done by specifying
a path to your data bags directory:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;chef_solo&quot; do |chef|
    chef.data_bags_path = &quot;data_bags&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Custom JSON Data</h2>

<p>Additional configuration data for Chef attributes can be passed in
to Chef Solo. This is done by setting the <code>json</code> property with a Ruby
hash (dictionary-like object), which is converted to JSON and passed
in to Chef:</p>

<pre><code>Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;chef_solo&quot; do |chef|
    # ...

    chef.json = {
      &quot;apache&quot; =&gt; {
        &quot;listen_address&quot; =&gt; &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;
      }
    }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Hashes, arrays, etc. can be used with the JSON configuration object. Basically,
anything that can be turned cleanly into JSON works.</p>

<h2>Custom Node Name</h2>

<p>You can specify a custom node name by setting the <code>node_name</code> property. This
is useful for cookbooks that may depend on this being set to some sort
of value. Example:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;chef_solo&quot; do |chef|
    chef.node_name = &quot;foo&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>
