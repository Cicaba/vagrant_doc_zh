<p>Let us look at some common examples first. See the bottom of this
document for a comprehensive list of options.</p>

<h2>Setting up a CFEngine server and client</h2>

<p>The CFEngine provisioner automatically installs the latest

on the VM, then configures and starts CFEngine according to your
specification.</p>

<p>Configuring a VM as a CFEngine policy server is easy:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;cfengine&quot; do |cf|
    cf.am_policy_hub = true
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The host will automatically be

to itself to become a policy server.</p>

<p>If you already have a working CFEngine policy server, you can get a
CFEngine client installed and bootstrapped by specifying its IP
address:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;cfengine&quot; do |cf|
    cf.policy_server_address = &quot;10.0.2.15&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Copying files to the VM</h2>

<p>If you have some policy or other files that you want to install by
default on a VM, you can use the <code>files_path</code> attribute:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
   config.vm.provision &quot;cfengine&quot; do |cf|
      cf.am_policy_hub = true
      cf.files_path = &quot;cfengine_files&quot;
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>Everything under <code>cfengine_files/</code> in the Vagrant project directory
will be recursively copied under <code>/var/cfengine/</code> in the VM, on top of
its default contents.</p>

<p>A common use case is to add your own files to
<code>/var/cfengine/masterfiles/</code> in the policy server. Assuming your extra
files are stored under <code>cfengine_files/masterfiles/</code>, the line shown
above will add them to the VM after CFEngine is installed, but before
it is bootstrapped.</p>

<h2>Modes of operation</h2>

<p>The default mode of operation is <code>:bootstrap</code>, which results in
CFEngine being bootstrapped according to the information provided in
the <code>Vagrantfile</code>. You can also set <code>mode</code> to <code>:single_run</code>, which
will run <code>cf-agent</code> once on the host to execute the file specified in
the <code>run_file</code> parameter, but will not bootstrap it, so it will not be
executed periodically.</p>

<p>The recommended mode of operation is <code>:bootstrap</code>, as you get the full
benefits of CFEngine when you have it running periodically.</p>

<h2>Running a standalone file</h2>

<p>If you want to run a standalone file, you can specify the <code>run_file</code>
parameter. The file will be copied to the VM and executed on its own
using <code>cf-agent</code>. Note that the file needs to be a standalone policy,
including its own
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/reference-components.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/reference-components.html#common-control%27" tppabs="http://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/reference-components.html#common-control"><code>body common control</code></a>.</p>

<p>The <code>run_file</code> parameter is mandatory if <code>mode</code> is set to
<code>:single_run</code>, but can also be specified when <code>mode</code> is set to
<code>:bootstrap</code> - in this case the file will be executed after the host
has been bootstrapped.</p>

<h2>Full Alphabetical List of Configuration Options</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>am_policy_hub</code> (boolean, default <code>false</code>) determines whether the VM will be
configured as a CFEngine policy hub (automatically bootstrapped to
its own IP address). You can combine it with <code>policy_server_address</code>
if the VM has multiple network interfaces and you want to bootstrap
to a specific one.</li>
<li><code>extra_agent_args</code> (string, default <code>nil</code>) can be used to pass
additional arguments to <code>cf-agent</code> when it is executed. For example,
you could use it to pass the <code>-I</code> or <code>-v</code> options to enable
additional output from the agent.</li>
<li><code>classes</code> (array, default <code>nil</code>) can be used to define additional
classes during <code>cf-agent</code> runs. These classes will be defined using
the <code>-D</code> option to <code>cf-agent</code>.</li>
<li><code>deb_repo_file</code> (string, default
<code>&quot;/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cfengine-community.list&quot;</code>) specifies the
file in which the CFEngine repository information will be stored in
Debian systems.</li>
<li><code>deb_repo_line</code> (string, default <code>&quot;deb http://cfengine.com/pub/apt
$(lsb_release -cs) main&quot;</code>) specifies the repository to use for
<code>.deb</code> packages.</li>
<li><code>files_path</code> (string, default <code>nil</code>) specifies a directory that will
be copied to the VM on top of the default
<code>/var/cfengine/</code> (the contents of <code>/var/cfengine/</code> will not
be replaced, the files will added to it).</li>
<li><code>force_bootstrap</code> (boolean, default <code>false</code>) specifies whether
CFEngine will be bootstrapped again even if the host has already
been bootstrapped.</li>
<li><code>install</code> (boolean or <code>:force</code>, default <code>true</code>) specifies whether
CFEngine will be installed on the VM if needed. If you set this
parameter to <code>:force</code>, then CFEngine will be reinstalled even if
it&#39;s already present on the machine.</li>
<li><code>mode</code> (<code>:bootstrap</code> or <code>:single_run</code>, default <code>:bootstrap</code>)
specifies whether CFEngine will be bootstrapped so that it executes
periodically, or will be run a single time. If <code>mode</code> is set to
<code>:single_run</code> you have to set <code>run_file</code>.</li>
<li><code>policy_server_address</code> (string, no default) specifies the IP
address of the policy server to which CFEngine will be
bootstrapped. If <code>am_policy_hub</code> is set to <code>true</code>, this parameter
defaults to the VM&#39;s IP address, but can still be set (for
example, if the VM has more than one network interface).</li>
<li><code>repo_gpg_key_url</code> (string, default
<code>&quot;http://cfengine.com/pub/gpg.key&quot;</code>) contains the URL to obtain the
GPG key used to verify the packages obtained from the repository.</li>
<li><code>run_file</code> (string, default <code>nil</code>) can be used to specify a file
inside the Vagrant project directory that will be copied to the VM
and executed once using <code>cf-agent</code>. This parameter is mandatory if
<code>mode</code> is set to <code>:single_run</code>, but can also be specified when
<code>mode</code> is set to <code>:bootstrap</code> - in this case the file will be
executed after the host has been bootstrapped.</li>
<li><code>upload_path</code> (string, default <code>&quot;/tmp/vagrant-cfengine-file&quot;</code>)
specifies the file to which <code>run_file</code> (if specified) will be copied
on the VM before being executed.</li>
<li><code>yum_repo_file</code> (string, default
<code>&quot;/etc/yum.repos.d/cfengine-community.repo&quot;</code>) specifies the file in
which the CFEngine repository information will be stored in RedHat
systems.</li>
<li><code>yum_repo_url</code> (string, default <code>&quot;http://cfengine.com/pub/yum/&quot;</code>)
specifies the URL of the repository to use for <code>.rpm</code> packages.</li>
<li><code>package_name</code> (string, default <code>&quot;cfengine-community&quot;</code>) specifies
the name of the package used to install CFEngine.</li>
</ul>
