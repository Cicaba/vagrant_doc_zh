<h1>Puppet Agent Provisioner</h1>

<p><strong>Provisioner name: <code>puppet_server</code></strong></p>

<p>The Puppet agent provisioner allows you to provision the guest using

calling <code>puppet agent</code>, connecting to a Puppet master, and retrieving
the set of modules and manifests from there.</p>

        <strong>Warning:</strong> If you're not familiar with Puppet and Vagrant already,
        I recommend starting with the <a href="shell.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/shell.html">shell
        provisioner</a>. However, if you're comfortable with Vagrant already, Vagrant
        is the best way to learn Puppet.

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>The <code>puppet_server</code> provisioner takes various options. None are strictly
required. They are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>client_cert_path</code> (string) - Path to the client certificate for the
node on your disk. This defaults to nothing, in which case a client
cert won&#39;t be uploaded.</p></li>
<li><p><code>client_private_key_path</code> (string) - Path to the client private key for
the node on your disk. This defaults to nothing, in which case a client
private key won&#39;t be uploaded.</p></li>
<li><p><code>facter</code> (hash) - Additional Facter facts to make available to the
Puppet run.</p></li>
<li><p><code>options</code> (string or array) - Additional command line options to pass
to <code>puppet agent</code> when Puppet is ran.</p></li>
<li><p><code>puppet_node</code> (string) - The name of the node. If this isn&#39;t set,
this will attempt to use a hostname if set via <code>config.vm.hostname</code>.
Otherwise, the box name will be used.</p></li>
<li><p><code>puppet_server</code> (string) - Hostname of the Puppet server. By default
&quot;puppet&quot; will be used.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Specifying the Puppet Master</h2>

<p>The quickest way to get started with the Puppet agent provisioner is to just
specify the location of the Puppet master:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;puppet_server&quot; do |puppet|
    puppet.puppet_server = &quot;puppet.example.com&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>By default, Vagrant will look for the host named &quot;puppet&quot; on the
local domain of the guest machine.</p>

<h2>Configuring the Node Name</h2>

<p>The node name that the agent registers as can be customized. Remember
this is important because Puppet uses the node name as part of the process
to compile the catalog the node will run.</p>

<p>The node name defaults to the hostname of the guest machine, but can
be customized using the Vagrantfile:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;puppet_server&quot; do |puppet|
    puppet.puppet_node = &quot;node.example.com&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Additional Options</h2>

<p>Puppet supports a lot of command-line flags. Basically any setting can
be overridden on the command line. To give you the most power and flexibility
possible with Puppet, Vagrant allows you to specify custom command line
flags to use:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;puppet_server&quot; do |puppet|
    puppet.options = &quot;--verbose --debug&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>
