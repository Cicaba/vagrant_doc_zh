<h1>Rebuild</h1>

<p>When you&#39;re ready to come back to your project, whether it is tomorrow,
a week from now, or a year from now, getting it up and running is easy:</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant up
</code></pre>

<p>That&#39;s it! Since the Vagrant environment is already all configured via
the Vagrantfile, you or any of your coworkers simply have to run a
<code>vagrant up</code> at any time and Vagrant will recreate your work environment.</p>
