<h1>Networking</h1>

<p>At this point we have a web server up and running with the ability to
modify files from our host and have them automatically synced to the guest.
However, accessing the web pages simply from the terminal from inside
the machine is not very satisfying. In this step, we&#39;ll use Vagrant&#39;s
<em>networking</em> features to give us additional options for accessing the
machine from our host machine.</p>

<h2>Port Forwarding</h2>

<p>One option is to use <em>port forwarding</em>. Port forwarding allows you to
specify ports on the guest machine to share via a port on the host machine.
This allows you to access a port on your own machine, but actually have
all the network traffic forwarded to a specific port on the guest machine.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s setup a forwarded port so we can access Apache in our guest. Doing so
is a simple edit to the Vagrantfile, which now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.box = &quot;hashicorp/precise32&quot;
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: &quot;bootstrap.sh&quot;
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, host: 4567, guest: 80
end
</code></pre>

<p>Run a <code>vagrant reload</code> or <code>vagrant up</code> (depending on if the machine
is already running) so that these changes can take effect.</p>

<p>Once the machine is running again, load <code>http://127.0.0.1:4567</code> in
your browser. You should see a web page that is being served from
the virtual machine that was automatically setup by Vagrant.</p>

<h2>Other Networking</h2>

<p>Vagrant also has other forms of networking, allowing you to assign
a static IP address to the guest machine, or to bridge the guest
machine onto an existing network. If you&#39;re interested in other options,
