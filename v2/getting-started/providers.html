<h1>Providers</h1>

<p>In this getting started guide, your project was always backed with
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.virtualbox.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.virtualbox.org/%27" tppabs="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. But Vagrant can work with
a wide variety of backend providers, such as <a href="../vmware/index.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vmware/">VMware</a>,
<a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws%27" tppabs="http://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws">AWS</a>, and more. Read the page
of each provider for more information on how to set them up.</p>

<p>Once you have a provider installed, you don&#39;t need to make any modifications
to your Vagrantfile, just <code>vagrant up</code> with the proper provider and
Vagrant will do the rest:</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant up --provider=vmware_fusion
...
</code></pre>

<p>Ready to move that to the cloud? Take it to AWS:</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant up --provider=aws
...
</code></pre>

<p>Once you run <code>vagrant up</code> with another provider, every other Vagrant
command doesn&#39;t need to be told what provider to use. Vagrant can automatically
figure it out. So when you&#39;re ready to SSH or destroy or anything else,
just run the commands like normal, such as <code>vagrant destroy</code>. No extra
flags necessary.</p>
