<h1>Provisioning</h1>

<p>目前，我们已经拥有一台运行着 Ubuntu 系统的虚拟机，且我们可以在宿主机上进行开发，文件自动同步到虚拟机中，下面我们将使用web服务器来执行同步目录下的文件。</p>

<p>We could just SSH in and install a webserver and be on our way, but then
every person who used Vagrant would have to do the same thing. Instead,
Vagrant has built-in support for <em>automated provisioning</em>. Using this
feature, Vagrant will automatically install software when you <code>vagrant up</code>
so that the guest machine can be repeatably created and ready-to-use.</p>

<h2>Installing Apache</h2>

<p>We&#39;ll just setup <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://httpd.apache.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://httpd.apache.org/%27" tppabs="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> for our basic project,
and we&#39;ll do so using a shell script. Create the following shell script
and save it as <code>bootstrap.sh</code> in the same directory as your Vagrantfile:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">#!/usr/bin/env bash

apt-get update
apt-get install -y apache2
if ! [ -L /var/www ]; then
  rm -rf /var/www
  ln -fs /vagrant /var/www
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we configure Vagrant to run this shell script when setting up
our machine. We do this by editing the Vagrantfile, which should now
look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.box = &quot;hashicorp/precise32&quot;
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: &quot;bootstrap.sh&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>The &quot;provision&quot; line is new, and tells Vagrant to use the <code>shell</code> provisioner
to setup the machine, with the <code>bootstrap.sh</code> file. The file path is relative
to the location of the project root (where the Vagrantfile is).</p>

<h2>Provision!</h2>

<p>After everything is configured, just run <code>vagrant up</code> to create your
machine and Vagrant will automatically provision it. You should see
the output from the shell script appear in your terminal. If the guest
machine is already running from a previous step, run <code>vagrant reload --provision</code>,
which will quickly restart your virtual machine, skipping the initial
import step. The provision flag on the reload command instructs Vagrant to
run the provisioners, since usually Vagrant will only do this on the first
<code>vagrant up</code>.</p>

<p>After Vagrant completes running, the web server will be up and running.
You can&#39;t see the website from your own browser (yet), but you can verify
that the provisioning works by loading a file from SSH within the machine:</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant ssh
...
vagrant@precise32:~$ wget -qO- 127.0.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>This works because in the shell script above we installed Apache and
setup the default <code>DocumentRoot</code> of Apache to point to our <code>/vagrant</code>
directory, which is the default synced folder setup by Vagrant.</p>

<p>You can play around some more by creating some more files and viewing
them from the terminal, but in the next step we&#39;ll cover networking
options so that you can use your own browser to access the guest machine.</p>
