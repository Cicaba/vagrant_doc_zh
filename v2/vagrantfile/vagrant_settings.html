<h1>Vagrant Settings</h1>

<p><strong>Config namespace: <code>config.vagrant</code></strong></p>

<p>The settings within <code>config.vagrant</code> modify the behavior of Vagrant
itself.</p>

<h2>Available Settings</h2>

<p><code>config.vagrant.host</code> - This sets the type of host machine that is running
Vagrant. By default this is <code>:detect</code>, which causes Vagrant to auto-detect
the host. Vagrant needs to know this information in order to perform some
host-specific things, such as preparing NFS folders if they&#39;re enabled.
You should only manually set this if auto-detection fails.</p>
