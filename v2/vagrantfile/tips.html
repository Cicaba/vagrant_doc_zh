<h1>Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>

<p>The Vagrantfile is a very flexible configuration format. Since it is just
Ruby, there is a lot you can do with it. However, in that same vein, since
it is Ruby, there are a lot of ways you can shoot yourself in the foot. When
using some of the tips and tricks on this page, please take care to use them
correctly.</p>

<h2>Loop Over VM Definitions</h2>

<p>If you want to apply a slightly different configuration to many
multi-machine machines, you can use a loop to do this. For example, if
you wanted to create three machines:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
(1..3).each do |i|
  config.vm.define "node-#{i}" do |node|
    node.vm.provision "shell",
      inline: "echo hello from node #{i}"
  end
end
</pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The inner portion of multi-machine definitions
and provider overrides are lazy-loaded. This can cause issues if you change
the value of a variable used within the configs. For example, the loop below
<em>does not work</em>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
# THIS DOES NOT WORK!
for i in 1..3 do
  config.vm.define "node-#{i}" do |node|
    node.vm.provision "shell",
      inline: "echo hello from node #{i}"
  end
end
</pre>

<p>The &quot;for i in  ...&quot; construct in Ruby actually modifies the value of <code>i</code>
for each iteration, rather than making a copy. Therefore, when you run this,
every node will actually provision with the same text.</p>

<p>This is an easy mistake to make, and Vagrant can&#39;t really protect against it,
so the best we can do is mention it here.</p>
