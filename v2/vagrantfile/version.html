<h1>Configuration Version</h1>

<p>Configuration versions are the mechanism by which Vagrant 1.1+ is able
to remain <a href="../installation/backwards-compatibility.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/backwards-compatibility.html">backwards compatible</a>
with Vagrant 1.0.x Vagrantfiles, while introducing dramatically new features
and configuration options.</p>

<p>If you run <code>vagrant init</code> today, the Vagrantfile will be in roughly the
following format:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>&quot;2&quot;</code> in the first line above represents the version of the configuration
object <code>config</code> that will be used for configuration for that block (the
section between the <code>do</code> and the <code>end</code>). This object can be very
different from version to version.</p>

<p>Currently, there are only two supported versions: &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;. Version 1
represents the configuration from Vagrant 1.0.x. &quot;2&quot; represents the configuration
for 1.1+ leading up to 2.0.x.</p>

<p>When loading Vagrantfiles, Vagrant uses the proper configuration object
for each version, and properly merges them, just like any other configuration.</p>

<p>The important thing to understand as a general user of Vagrant is that
<em>within a single configuration section</em>, only a single version can be used.
You can&#39;t use the new <code>config.vm.provider</code> configurations in a version 1
configuration section. Likewise, <code>config.vm.forward_port</code> won&#39;t work
in a version 2 configuration section (it was renamed).</p>

<p>If you want, you can mix and match multiple configuration versions in the
same Vagrantfile. This is useful if you found some useful configuration
snippet or something that you want to use. Example:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;1&quot;) do |config|
  # v1 configs...
end

Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  # v2 configs...
end
</code></pre>

        <strong>What is <code>Vagrant::Config.run</code>?</strong>
        You may see this in Vagrantfiles. This was actually how Vagrant 1.0.x
        did configuration. In Vagrant 1.1+, this is synonymous with
        <code>Vagrant.configure("1")</code>.
