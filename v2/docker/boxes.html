<h1>Docker Boxes</h1>

<p>The Docker provider doesn&#39;t require a Vagrant box. The <code>config.vm.box</code>
setting is completely optional.</p>

<p>A box can still be used and specified, however, to provide defaults.
Because the <code>Vagrantfile</code> within a box is loaded as part of the
configuration loading sequence, it can be used to configure the
foundation of a development environment.</p>

<p>In general, however, you won&#39;t need a box with the Docker provider.</p>
