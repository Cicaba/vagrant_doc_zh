<h1>Docker</h1>

<p>Vagrant comes with support out of the box for
using Docker as a provider. This allows for your development environments
to be backed by Docker containers rather than virtual machines. Additionally,
it provides for a good workflow for developing Dockerfiles.</p>

        <strong>Warning: Docker knowledge assumed.</strong> We assume that
        you know what Docker is and that you're comfortable with the basics
        of Docker. If not, we recommend starting with another provider such
        as <a href="javascript:$('#contentWrap').load('virtualbox/index.html')" >VirtualBox</a>.
