<h1>Multi-Machine</h1>

<p>Vagrant is able to define and control multiple guest machines per
Vagrantfile. This is known as a &quot;multi-machine&quot; environment.</p>

<p>These machines are generally able to work together or are somehow associated
with each other. Here are some use-cases people are using multi-machine
environments for today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accurately modeling a multi-server production topology, such as separating
a web and database server.</li>
<li>Modeling a distributed system and how they interact with each other.</li>
<li>Testing an interface, such as an API to a service component.</li>
<li>Disaster-case testing: machines dying, network partitions, slow networks,
inconsistent world views, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Historically, running complex environments such as these was done by
flattening them onto a single machine. The problem with that is that it is
an inaccurate model of the production setup, which can behave far differently.</p>

<p>Using the multi-machine feature of Vagrant, these environments can be modeled
in the context of a single Vagrant environment without losing any of the
benefits of Vagrant.</p>

<h2>Defining Multiple Machines</h2>

<p>Multiple machines are defined within the same project <a href="../vagrantfile/index.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/">Vagrantfile</a>
using the <code>config.vm.define</code> method call. This configuration directive
is a little funny, because it creates a Vagrant configuration within a
configuration. An example shows this best:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.provision &quot;shell&quot;, inline: &quot;echo Hello&quot;

  config.vm.define &quot;web&quot; do |web|
    web.vm.box = &quot;apache&quot;
  end

  config.vm.define &quot;db&quot; do |db|
    db.vm.box = &quot;mysql&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>config.vm.define</code> takes a block with another variable. This
variable, such as <code>web</code> above, is the <em>exact</em> same as the <code>config</code> variable,
except any configuration of the inner variable applies only to the machine
being defined. Therefore, any configuration on <code>web</code> will only affect the
<code>web</code> machine.</p>

<p>And importantly, you can continue to use the <code>config</code> object as well. The
configuration object is loaded and merged before the machine-specific configuration,
just like other Vagrantfiles within the
<a href="../vagrantfile/index.htm#load-order" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/#load-order">Vagrantfile load order</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re familiar with programming, this is similar to how languages have
different variable scopes.</p>

<p>When using these scopes, order of execution for things such as
provisioners becomes important. Vagrant enforces ordering outside-in, in
the order listed in the Vagrantfile. For example, with the Vagrantfile
below:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
    config.vm.provision :shell, inline: &#39;echo A&#39;
    config.vm.define :testing do |test|
        test.vm.provision :shell, inline: &#39;echo B&#39;
    end
    config.vm.provision :shell, inline: &#39;echo C&#39;
end
</code></pre>

<p>The provisioners in this case will output &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;B&quot;. Notice
that &quot;B&quot; is last. That is because the ordering is outside-in, in
the order of the file.</p>

<h2>Controlling Multiple Machines</h2>

<p>The moment more than one machine is defined within a Vagrantfile, the
usage of the various <code>vagrant</code> commands changes slightly. The change should
be mostly intuitive.</p>

<p>Commands that only make sense to target a single machine, such as
<code>vagrant ssh</code>, now <em>require</em> the name of the machine to control. Using
the example above, you would say <code>vagrant ssh web</code> or <code>vagrant ssh db</code>.</p>

<p>Other commands, such as <code>vagrant up</code>, operate on <em>every</em> machine by
default. So if you ran <code>vagrant up</code>, Vagrant would bring up both the
web and DB machine. You could also optionally be specific and say
<code>vagrant up web</code> or <code>vagrant up db</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can specify a regular expression for matching only
certain machines. This is useful in some cases where you specify many similar
machines, for example if you&#39;re testing a distributed service you may have
a <code>leader</code> machine as well as a <code>follower0</code>, <code>follower1</code>, <code>follower2</code>, etc. If you
want to bring up all the followers but not the leader, you can just do
<code>vagrant up /follower[0-9]/</code>. If Vagrant sees a machine name within forward
slashes, it assumes you&#39;re using a regular expression.</p>

<h2>Communication Between Machines</h2>

<p>In order to facilitate communication within machines in a multi-machine setup,
the various <a href="../networking/index.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/">networking</a> options should be used.
In particular, the <a href="../networking/private_network.html" tppabs="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/private_network.html">private network</a> can
be used to make a private network between multiple machines and the host.</p>

<h2>Specifying a Primary Machine</h2>

<p>You can also specify a <em>primary machine</em>. The primary machine will be the
default machine used when a specific machine in a multi-machine environment
is not specified.</p>

<p>To specify a default machine, just mark it primary when defining it. Only
one primary machine may be specified.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">config.vm.define &quot;web&quot;, primary: true do |web|
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Autostart Machines</h2>

<p>By default in a multi-machine environment, <code>vagrant up</code> will start
all of the defined machines. The <code>autostart</code> setting allows you to tell
Vagrant to <em>not</em> start specific machines. Example:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">config.vm.define &quot;web&quot;
config.vm.define &quot;db&quot;
config.vm.define &quot;db_follower&quot;, autostart: false
</code></pre>

<p>When running <code>vagrant up</code> with the settings above, Vagrant will automatically
start the &quot;web&quot; and &quot;db&quot; machines, but will not start the &quot;db_follower&quot; machine.
You can manually force the &quot;db_follower&quot; machine to start by running
<code>vagrant up db_follower</code>.</p>
